# Tictactoe but with ✨arrays✨
I built this for fun, i just wanted to build the most hard version of tictactoe as possible. It works with arrays.
## How its built
- First it starts with 3 arrays, toprow (the toprow array) middlerow (the middlerow array) and bottomrow (the bottomrow array)
- It then asks for the move you want to make, you make a move such as B2 (this will put an X or an 0 (depending on the player) in the middle of the board)
- Since all of this is inside a while true loop (2 while true loops) it just goes back and forth
- The checking method to see if you got 3 in a row
## CheckList

[ ] Build the main method to check
[ ] Add more moves (the only moves are A1 and A2, and that is just for player1)
[ ] Make it look good
